February 19th:
    - Working on adjusting missions page to mock-up
        - Two grid system finished 
        - Get image with border radius and truncated
    - Big thing to notice: in order to make things easier to adjust irt mobile formatting,
        make sure you set up text-size clamps such that text size is not completely relative to screensize (ensure readability)

February 27th:
    - Add image wrapper to photo on page 2
        - add media styling for Group-Outside-Cropped
    - Add video playback behind main landing no audio
    - Get image with border radius proper

    DEBRIEF:
        - Image wrapper finished (no media styling yet)
        - Video playback added 
        - Border radius added on top corners

Mar 1st:
    - Figure out video tearing on slowdown, maybe replace video with even more slowge
    - Meet the singers page on page 3 to mock-up
    - Replace home page logos with assets from 2025 drive (TLP-logo-plus-lily or white, TLP-logo-lily or white)

Mar 10th:
    - Haven't touched video tearing yet. Meet the singers page on page 3 for mock-up is main goal for today
    - Home page logo replacement assets are done I think but need to double check.
    - For embla carousel, pivot back from dots to arrows
        - Keep swipe enabled along with arrows
        - Arrows reimplemented with arrows pointing outwards
    Active notes:
    - Maybe figure out formatting to get arrows to be closer and take less vertical div space (ie arrows enclosing carousel)
    - Portraits with border radius fixed (px and % border radius are calculated differently; 999px prevents elliptic shape)
    - Font styling for descriptions and class cleaning


Mar 12th:
    - Haven't touched video tearing still.
    - Meet the singers carousel still needs slight layout adjustments, background color and translucent lily stamp
    - arrows are in
    - two more cards additional

    Order of today:
    - Singers carousel backdrop, font/styling, filler descriptions, evergreen
    - Add frame of two more cards

    Active Notes:
    - carousel backdrop font styling filler desc, colors done, transparent drop background done
    - Frame for two cards not done
    - Sticky header given mix-blend-mode difference but colors are a bit odd on negatives, need to find a better work around
    - Video tearing completely ignored gg
    - Against the lighter background the images have various levels of brightness that bothers me >:(

Mar 19:
    - Moved the past weekend and didn't really get anything done in terms of website
    - Possibly pivot from transparent sticky footer to fixed icons bottom right

Mar 21:
    - Goal: by the end of the day have the website live with information directing to the concert coming up in april
    - Is the current iteration of the website that is being developed ready for live? Not in full. The mobile layout needs work for all the new adjustments.
    - Plan today is to replace the link from the previous concert to the current concert, and push a live version of the website with all the changes early next week.
