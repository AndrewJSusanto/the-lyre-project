February 19th:
    - Working on adjusting missions page to mock-up
        - Two grid system finished 
        - Get image with border radius and truncated
    - Big thing to notice: in order to make things easier to adjust irt mobile formatting,
        make sure you set up text-size clamps such that text size is not completely relative to screensize (ensure readability)

February 27th:
    - Add image wrapper to photo on page 2
        - add media styling for Group-Outside-Cropped
    - Add video playback behind main landing no audio
    - Get image with border radius proper

    DEBRIEF:
        - Image wrapper finished (no media styling yet)
        - Video playback added 
        - Border radius added on top corners

Mar 1st:
    - Figure out video tearing on slowdown, maybe replace video with even more slowge
    - Meet the singers page on page 3 to mock-up
    - Replace home page logos with assets from 2025 drive (TLP-logo-plus-lily or white, TLP-logo-lily or white)

Mar 10th:
    - Haven't touched video tearing yet. Meet the singers page on page 3 for mock-up is main goal for today
    - Home page logo replacement assets are done I think but need to double check.
    - For embla carousel, pivot back from dots to arrows
        - Keep swipe enabled along with arrows
        - Arrows reimplemented with arrows pointing outwards
    Active notes:
    - Maybe figure out formatting to get arrows to be closer and take less vertical div space (ie arrows enclosing carousel)
    - Portraits with border radius fixed (px and % border radius are calculated differently; 999px prevents elliptic shape)
    - Font styling for descriptions and class cleaning


Mar 12th:
    - Haven't touched video tearing still.
    - Meet the singers carousel still needs slight layout adjustments, background color and translucent lily stamp
    - arrows are in
    - two more cards additional

    Order of today:
    - Singers carousel backdrop, font/styling, filler descriptions, evergreen
    - Add frame of two more cards

    Active Notes:
    - carousel backdrop font styling filler desc, colors done, transparent drop background done
    - Frame for two cards not done
    - Sticky header given mix-blend-mode difference but colors are a bit odd on negatives, need to find a better work around
    - Video tearing completely ignored gg
    - Against the lighter background the images have various levels of brightness that bothers me >:(

Mar 19:
    - Moved the past weekend and didn't really get anything done in terms of website
    - Possibly pivot from transparent sticky footer to fixed icons bottom right

Mar 21:
    - Goal: by the end of the day have the website live with information directing to the concert coming up in april
    - Is the current iteration of the website that is being developed ready for live? Not in full. The mobile layout needs work for all the new adjustments.
    - Plan today is to replace the link from the previous concert to the current concert, and push a live version of the website with all the changes early next week.

    Active Notes:
    - Concert link to facebook now live on the current website
    - Need to increase brightness of photos for singers

Mar 27 + 28:
    Goals:
        - Organizing styling before mobile overhaul
        - Start on mobile overhaul
            - Multiple ways to go about where to start:
                - Sticky header on top resized/redesigned for mobile use (could use the three lines system top right for menu)
                - Landing page with TLP crest resizing
                - Sticky footer adjusted for logos to be visible (either larger or redesign footer)
            - Overall text sizing for mobile devices needs to be fixed to standard before adjusting box placement
    - adding a link for new concert on overhaul
    - Added onclick event for landing page to pause/play autoplayed video with visual feedback
    
    Active Notes:
        - I think the best course of action would be to just see what the pages look like on mobile sizing first before doing anything.
            - Notes after first look:
                - Sticky Header:
                    - Top Left and Top Right styling makes it so that the logo and the nav bar on top right are extremely small on mobile
                    - Pivot to Threebar system on top right and remove TLP static logo on top left @mobile
                - Landing:
                    - TLP Center Crest too small, can be sized up
                    - text size for concert redirect way too small, needs to be increased in reference to size of Crest
                    - Tapping on screen functions correctly with pausing/playing bg video
                - About Us:
                    - Image currently is statically connected to bottom right of screen, needs adjusting and resizing for mobile
                        - Something like image bottom center of phone, with About Us section directly on top
                        - Refer to mock-up for correct spacing and sizing.
                - Our Singers:
                    - Carousel too small and designed for horizontal screens.
                    - Research embla carousel for specifics on mobile styling; make it so the box is column based.
                - Projects:
                    - "Featured Projects" text and YT svg needs upsizing.
                    - Looks alright, least amount of work to be done for it. Eventually maybe after clicking a video, animation to slide to center and dim background
                - Sticky Footer:
                    - Sticky footer sizing surprisingly decent, but needs adjusting for spacing. Currently sitting slightly offset to the right.
                    - Center the three SVG options on the footer navbar.

        - Course of action for today:
            - Easiest first, experiment with changing default text sizing on mobile
            - Resize Landing page logo at mobile layout
            - Resize textbox for concert-redirect to be in line with TLP Crest.
Mar 29:
   - Sticky Header:
                - Top Left and Top Right styling makes it so that the logo and the nav bar on top right are extremely small on mobile
                - Pivot to Threebar system on top right and remove TLP static logo on top left @mobile
    3 bar system in place, just need to pop up the nav bar menu options. Rest should be pretty easy (mostly text and div arrangement). 
    - getting frustrated with 3 bar shit and popping up being in the wrong place maybe I'm tired.

April 7th:
    - Been avoiding things. I should do the finishing touches on the nav bar changes and then everything else will be easy.
    - Later on, sub in the blurb text via Christine/Mimi
    - The navbar for mobile only is affecting the structure of the desktop nav bar. Instead of making the navbar invisible on mobile,
        I should make entirely seperate divs to be placed as sticky headers for excl. mobile and excl. desktop

April 9th:
    - Navbar figured out. Things to fix that I notice:
        - bg color outline on video page on specific mobile sizings
        - text-size overhaul for mobile
        - elements on other pages
        - figure out autopause when scrolling out of landing (page out of focus -> autoplay off)
        - About Page
        - Singers Page
        - Projects Page
            - All three need looking at for mobile sizing corrections

    - Blurbs added in via Christine's message -> google doc 


April 10th:
    - Order of operations today:
        - Update default text size for mobile
        - Adjust about page image sizing to mock up
        - Singers page embla

About page done for now

mobile in-concert-heading text larger, box larger


Future:
change header function depending on touch devices 


jan 29
so i need to just get a batch of photos, get them all jpg, upload them with my batch script, then populate with some js script clientside so the gallery can fill up
also fslightbox is configured so lets hope fslightbox and cloudinary can work together.

got batch of photos, now getting them all jpg
then will upload all with batch script
got them all into folder, now run bashscript to upload to cloudinary
got them uploaded to cloudinary with predictable urls following the format of https://res.cloudinary.com/dzvswz1rz/image/upload/v1769809986/tlp/gallery/xx.jpg
Now write/enable script to populate gallery using this format
Populated the website with the images (thumbnails are still broken because of weird stuff)
nvm I got the thumbnails generated now im insane
Now I need to configure fslightbox such that if an image is clicked it pulls open the actual image
fix mobile styling = DDDDDDD
